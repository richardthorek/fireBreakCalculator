# Implementation Summary: Hand Crew Productivity with Fuel Models

## Overview
Successfully implemented adjustable hand crew productivity rates with fuel model support, crew size scaling, and environmental factors as requested in issue #8.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Fuel Model Data (Table 3 Integration)
- **7 Standard Fuel Models**: Short Grass, Open Timber Grass, Chaparral, Brush, Dormant Brush, Closed Timber Litter, Hardwood Litter
- **Accurate Data Conversion**: Converted from feet/hour for 20-person crews to meters/hour per person
- **Crew Type Support**: Type I (IHC) and Type II (Initial Attack) with different productivity rates
- **Attack Methods**: Direct attack (higher rates) and indirect attack (lower rates)

### 2. User Interface
- **Fuel Model Selection**: Dropdown with 7 fuel types
- **Crew Configuration**: Type I/II selection, Direct/Indirect attack method
- **Crew Size**: Adjustable from 1-50 people with linear scaling
- **Manual Rate Override**: Custom rate input in meters/hour per person
- **Real-time Rate Display**: Shows calculated rate based on selections

### 3. Calculation Engine
- **Linear Crew Scaling**: 10 people = 2× rate of 5 people
- **Environmental Factors**: Terrain (1.0× to 2.2×) and vegetation (1.0× to 2.5×) multipliers
- **Formula**: `Final Rate = (Base Rate ÷ Terrain Factor ÷ Vegetation Factor) × Crew Size`
- **Time Calculation**: `Time = Distance ÷ Final Rate`

### 4. Documentation
- **Fuel Model Reference**: Comprehensive guide with all rates and usage guidelines
- **User Guide Updates**: Added fuel model sections with examples
- **Technical Documentation**: Calculation formulas and data sources

## Data Validation

### Example Calculations (1000m fire break)
- **Type I, Short Grass, Direct, 20 people, Easy terrain**: 2.92 hours
- **Same with difficult terrain**: 4.97 hours (+70% time)
- **Same with 10 people**: 5.85 hours (2× longer)
- **Type II crew**: 5.21 hours (1.8× longer than Type I)

### Conversion Accuracy
- **Original**: 1,122 ft/hr for 20-person Type I crew in Short Grass (Direct)
- **Converted**: 1,122 ÷ 3.281 ÷ 20 = 17.1 m/hr per person ✓
- **Verification**: 20 × 17.1 = 342 m/hr = 1,122 ft/hr ✓

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Added
- `src/types/config.ts` - Extended types for fuel models and crew configurations
- `src/config/fuelModels.ts` - Fuel model data with all conversions
- `src/config/defaultConfig.ts` - Added fuel model crews and data
- `src/components/AnalysisPanel.tsx` - Enhanced UI and calculation logic
- `src/styles.css` - Added styling for new controls
- `Documentation/FUEL_MODELS.md` - Comprehensive reference guide
- `Documentation/USER_GUIDE.md` - Updated with fuel model information

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly controls and layout
- **Performance**: Efficient calculations with proper memoization
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented code with clear separation of concerns

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **User Configuration**: Set estimated distance per hour OR choose from presets  
✅ **Crew Size Scaling**: Linear scaling (1 person at 1m/min = 10 people at 10m/min)  
✅ **Environmental Factors**: Uphill segments and heavy vegetation reduce progress  
✅ **Meters/Hour Display**: All rates converted and displayed in meters/hour  
✅ **Data Conversion**: Table 3 data accurately converted from feet/hour  
✅ **UI Integration**: Follows existing conventions and design patterns  
✅ **Documentation**: Logic and references documented in `Documentation/`  

## Testing Results

All calculations validated:
- Linear crew size scaling works correctly
- Environmental factors properly reduce productivity
- Type I crews outperform Type II crews as expected
- Manual rate override functions properly
- UI responds correctly to all input changes

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements in issue #8 with accurate data, intuitive interface, and comprehensive documentation.
